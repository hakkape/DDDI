  We introduce an effective and efficient iterative
  algorithm for solving the continuous-time service network
  design problem. The algorithm achieves its efficiency by
  carefully and dynamically refining partially time-expanded
  network models so that only a small number of small
  integer programs, defined over these networks, need to be
  solved. An extensive computational study shows that the
  algorithm performs well in practice, often using
  time-expanded network models with size much less than 1%
  (in terms of number of variables and constraints) of a
  full time-expanded network model. The algorithm is
  inspired by and has many similarities to the dynamic
  discretization discovery algorithm introduced in Boland et
  al. [Boland N, Hewitt M, Marshall L, Savelsbergh M (2017)
  The continuous-time service network design problem. Oper.
  Res. 65(5):1303â€“1321.], but generates smaller partially
  time-expanded models, produces high-quality solutions more
  quickly, and converges more quickly.
