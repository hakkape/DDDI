## Interval-based Dynamic Discretization Discovery for solving the Continuous-Time Service Network Design Problem

This repository contains some of the code and instances associated with the [DDDI paper published in Transportation Science (2020).](https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2020.0994)

## Code Information
Most of the code is quite old, written during my PhD (2014 - 2017), with slight changes made to work on Python 3.x. Also, I've recently added support for reading instances from [SND-RR](https://github.com/madisonvandyk/snd-rr).

I never originally intended to release the code, so it has many hacks and is quite ugly! But for my own peace-of-mind I plan to slowly clean it up.

That said, it seems like there is ongoing research into DDD, and this code is still quite competitive with state-of-the-art. So it might be useful for comparisons.
